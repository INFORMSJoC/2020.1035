# Companion Data Files for frvcpy

This directory contains the data files required to run the [example scripts](../scripts/). The examples follow the "Example Usage" section (5.2) in the research article (_link coming soon_).

- `frvcpy-instance.schema.json`: JSON schema defining valid instances for frvcpy.
- `frvcpy-instance.json`: A valid frvcpy instance.
- `vrprep-instance.xml`: An instance in the [VRP-REP](http://www.vrp-rep.org/) format, for which frvcpy offers a translator.

Note that the example instance files are included with the frvcpy package; they can also be found in [/src/frvcpy/test/data](../src/frvcpy/test/data).
