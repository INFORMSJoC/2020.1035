# Results

This directory contains the results of the example from the [research article](https://doi.org/10.1287/ijoc.2020.1035) (Section 5.2), which also corresponds to the output of the example scripts [found here](../scripts).

- [`my-solution.xml`](./my-solution.xml) is the energy-feasible route for the FRVCP solved in this example, produced by frvcpy in [VRP-REP format](http://vrp-rep.org/resources.html).
- [`frvcp-solution.pdf`](./frvcp-solution.pdf) is an illustration of the solution: the gray arrow denotes the original, energy-infeasible route, and the black arrow indicates the prescribed detour resulting in the minimum-duration energy-feasible route.
