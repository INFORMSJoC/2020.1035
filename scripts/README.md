# Scripts

The scripts in this directory recreate the example in Section 5.2 from the research article (_link coming soon_). These scripts translate an instance from the VRP-REP format, solve an FRVCP from this instance, then write the solution to file. We provide both a [shell](./frvcpy-example.sh) and [Python](./frvcpy-example.py) script.
