# Scripts

The scripts in this directory recreate the example in Section 5.2 from the [research article](https://doi.org/10.1287/ijoc.2020.1035). These scripts translate an instance from the VRP-REP format, solve an FRVCP from this instance, then write the solution to file. We provide both a [shell](./frvcpy-example.sh) and [Python](./frvcpy-example.py) script.
